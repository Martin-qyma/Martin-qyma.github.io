I am a first-year CS Ph.D. student at UC Davis, co-advised by Professor [Zhe Zhao](https://sites.google.com/view/zhezhao) and Professor [Junshan Zhang](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/jzhang). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor degree at The University of Hong Kong (HKU).

My research interests center on Large Language Models (**LLMs**) and Information Retrieval (**IR**), with a particular focus on developing generative models that align with human interactions and preferences (reinforcement learning, reward modeling), as well as on retrieving and reasoning over complex relational structures (recommender systems).
