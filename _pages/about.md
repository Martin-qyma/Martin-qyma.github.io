Hi there! I am a senior Math & CS undergrad at University of Hong Kong (HKU). I'm currently seeking a CS Ph.D. position starting from Fall 2025.

My research interests lie in large language models and information retrieval, with a focus on developing generative models that can retrieve and reason over relational structures. I'm particularly interested in the recommender systems and graph representation learning.

I am also open to other topics. Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat!
