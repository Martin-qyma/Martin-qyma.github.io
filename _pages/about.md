Hi there! I am a senior undergrad at University of Hong Kong (HKU), majoring in computer science and mathematics.

My research interests broadly lie in **graph neural networks** and **large language models**, with applications in **recommender systems**.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to brainstorm ideas, discuss potential projects, or just geek out about the latest developments in our field. I'm open to other related areas as well.

Recent News
