Hi there! I am a senior undergrad at University of Hong Kong (HKU), majoring in computer science and mathematics.

My research interests lie in recommender systems and large language models, with a focus on developing machine learning models that can retrieve and reason over relational structures, graphs, and networks. I am particularly interested in graph neural networks and multi-modal foundation models.

I am also open to other topics. Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat!
