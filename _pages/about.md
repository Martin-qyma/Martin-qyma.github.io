Hi there! I am a senior undergrad at University of Hong Kong (HKU), majoring in computer science and mathematics.

My research interests lie in large language models and recommender systems, with a focus on developing generative models that can retrieve and reason over relational structures, graphs, and networks.

I am also open to other topics. Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat!
