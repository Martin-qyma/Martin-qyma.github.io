Hi there! I am a senior undergrad at University of Hong Kong (HKU), majoring in computer science and mathematics.

My research interests primarily lie in recommender systems, with a focus on developing machine learning models that can reason over richly-labeled relational structures, graphs, and networks. I am particularly interested in applying graph neural networks and large language models to create multi-modal foundation models for recommendation tasks.

I am also open to other topics. Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat!
