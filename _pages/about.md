Hi there! I am an incoming PhD student at UC Davis, co-advised by Prof. [Zhe Zhao](https://sites.google.com/view/zhezhao) and Prof. [Junshan Zhang](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/jzhang). Currently, I am an undergraduate at The University of Hong Kong (HKU) and a research intern at Tencent.

My research interests generally lie in Large Language Models (**LLMs**) and Information Retrieval (**IR**), with a focus on developing generative models that can retrieve and reason over relational structures.

I am also open to other topics. Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat!
